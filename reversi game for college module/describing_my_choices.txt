My choices, are choices that I have made.

I chose to represent the board and players as structs.

Board contains a two dimensional character array, an array of two integers representing the two players' scores, and a single integer representing the player whose turn it is currently.

The player structs have the name and the letter used to represent disc colors, either B for black disc or W for white disc.

I decided to make a function that scans the entire board for valid moves, then outputs a list of those, and you can check the user's input against this list and know immediately if it is not a valid move, but you still have to search in all 8 directions when you are actually enacting the move unfortunately. 

At least whether or not it has the opponent's piece in the cell right next to the examined cell is an easy test and narrows the directions to search from 8 to only however many have the opponent's pieces.
